My name is Shawn Hansen. I am a web and mobile developer.

I am currently employed at the [University of Wisconsin Oshkosh](http://www.uwosh.edu) as the Senior Web Programmer. Most of the code I write for UW Oshkosh is on [GitHub](http://www.github.com/uwoshkosh).

I also take on contract work when I have the time. I'm currently working with [Graf Technology](http://www.graftechnology.com).

If you're interested in having some web or mobile work done, shoot me an email at [shawn.hansen@gmail.com](mailto:shawn.hansen@gmail.com).
